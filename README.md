GameKit Easy Module [![Titanium](http://www-static.appcelerator.com/badges/titanium-git-badge-sq.png)](http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/)
===
This is a module that integrates Apple's Game Kit API. Currently Leaderboards and Achievements are supported.
You don't need to create a way to save scores locally because this module do it for you, and when a internet connection is available, it sends to Game Center server automagically. ;-)

**Remember:** Logout your regular Game Center account to enable Sandbox mode.
